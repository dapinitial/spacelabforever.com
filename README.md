# spacelabforever.com
spacelabforever.com served thanks to Node.js, presenting with React.js and TypeScript on a custom webpack+scss. It's just a basic fun website and playground.  Just need to make more time! Piece mealing together from old projects and kicking the dust off of other things now that I have the hang of it...  "wish I knew then what I know now..."

Sensors are live and uploading to Azure with Python from trinkey circuitPython on RaspberryPi.

Persisting to CosmosDB (soon to be Azure table for cost reduction). 

## Includes: 
-  React audio player (Use KEXP API),
-  LIVE mycological sensor data visualizions via SCD41 custom python server from trinkey to RaspberryPi stored on azure
-  Live YMCA pools and group fitness classes displayed via API

- [ ] YMCA + Vertical World + Seattle Bouldering Project AI scheduler that will determine where you are at any given time and recommend classes and swims that you have 20-30 minutes to make it to... helping to keep you on task.
- [ ] Challenges for calisthenics and runs with MapMyRun, NikeApp, and Strava will also make their way into the web app...
- [ ] Will be creating a guestbook that saves cursor movement and clicks so registered guests can leave a data visualization in the graffiti wall as a tag, and will add some commenting, etc.
